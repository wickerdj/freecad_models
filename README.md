# FreeCAD

A place to hold models that were created in FreeCAD

The fcstd1 files are a type of backup file that is auto-created by FreeCAD. I am including the file as extra safety.


AngleIronConstructiveSolidGeometry is from a tutorail.

AngleIronByExtrudingProfile is from a tutorial.

BasicPartDesignTutorial is from a tutorial.

ImpossibleDovetail is my first attempt at creating this object. I mostly used the Parts Workbench to fuse shapes together.

ImpossibleDovetail2 is my second attempt. This used a sketch to slice/split the cube into two parts. This design is not printable. Maybe a newer version of FreeCAD could help.

ImpossibleDovetail3 is my third attempt. I learned enough to make something that is printable. The tolerances on the first print was too tight. I applied a tweak to the model that got something workable.

ImpossibleDovetailRework is my fourth attempt. In this version, I fixed several issues with the basic sketch and I am working more with tolerances.

PlateWithFourHoles is from a tutorial and playing around in the tool.

ResistorBox is my first attempt at simple resistor box.

ResistorBoxReworkBottom is new version of the ResistorBox. In this case, I applied more of learning on FreeCAD. I am also trying a different way of handling documents in FreeCAD. 

ResistorBoxReworkTop is new version of the ResistorBox. In this case, I applied more of learning on FreeCAD. I am also trying a different way of handling documents in FreeCAD.

S-clip is a simple clip for a belt on my 3D Printer. Simple design to help start learning FreeCAD.

SimonSonicScrewdrive. Simon designed his own Sonic Screwdriver. I am working on the model to 3D print and helping him with the real world aspects of the project. 

SimpleCaseForUsbMemorStick. I need a simple case for a thumb drive. This could use refinement.

TurnersCube is from a tutorial.

TutorialLego is a from a tutorial. It is a simple 2x4 Lego block. This was really important tutorial for me. It is where I first began to understand the workbenchs and the power of FreeCAD. https://www.freecadweb.org/wiki/Manual:Modeling_for_product_design
