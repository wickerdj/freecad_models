# FreeCAD

A place to hold models that were created in FreeCAD

The fcstd1 files are a type of backup file that is auto-created by FreeCAD. I am including the file as extra safety.

## Folders

* 3d-printing - files intended for 3D Printing
  * boxes
    * ResistorBox is my first attempt at simple resistor box.
    * ResistorBoxReworkBottom is new version of the ResistorBox. In this case, I applied more of learning on FreeCAD. I am also trying a different way of handling documents in FreeCAD. 
    * ResistorBoxReworkTop is new version of the ResistorBox. In this case, I applied more of learning on FreeCAD. I am also trying a different way of handling documents in FreeCAD.
    * SimpleCaseForUsbMemorStick. I need a simple case for a thumb drive. This could use refinement.
  * clips
    * CargoNetCLipIdeas - playing with ideas for making a clip/hook to link a cargo net to tie down points
    * S-clip - needed a simple s shape with notchs in the top an bottom arms. The main idea is help increase the tension on some belts.
  * electorics
    * ElectronicsLabCore - starting platform that could be used to assemble electronics project on. The central plate is a little bigger than a raspberry pi. The individual plates would have tab and slots to allow the additional plates to be hooked together. 
  * impossible-dovertail
    * ImpossibleDovetail is my first attempt at creating this object. I mostly used the Parts Workbench to fuse shapes together.
    * ImpossibleDovetail2 is my second attempt. This used a sketch to slice/split the cube into two parts. This design is not printable. Maybe a newer version of FreeCAD could help.
    * ImpossibleDovetail3 is my third attempt. I learned enough to make something that is printable. The tolerances on the first print was too tight. I applied a tweak to the model that got something workable.
    * ImpossibleDovetailRework is my fourth attempt. In this version, I fixed several issues with the basic sketch and I am working more with tolerances.
  * SimonSonicScrewdriver - Simon designed his own Sonic Screwdriver. I am working on the model to 3D print and helping him with the real world aspects of the project.
* learn - files intended to learn about FreeCAD
  * AngleIronConstructiveSolidGeometry is from a tutorail.
  * AngleIronByExtrudingProfile is from a tutorial.
  * BasicPartDesignTutorial is from a tutorial.
  * PlateWithFourHoles is from a tutorial and playing around in the tool.
  * TurnersCube is from a tutorial.
  * TutorialLego is a from a tutorial. It is a simple 2x4 Lego block. This was really important tutorial for me. It is where I first began to understand the workbenchs and the power of FreeCAD. https://www.freecadweb.org/wiki/Manual:Modeling_for_product_design
* woodworking
  * breadbox
    * Attempt3
      * Attempt3 - is the main file.
    * breadbox - playing with FreeCAD to learn how to use the program for woodworking projects
    * BreadBoxAttemp2 - refining the basic idea from breadbox file.
